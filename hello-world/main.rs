fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
// Few things:
// 0. main() is the entry point of every Rust program
// 1. println() is a function, println!() is a macro, will discuss more about macro in chapter 19
// 2. println!() is used to print a line to the terminal, it takes a format string as an argument
// 3. ; indicates the end of an expression, every expression in Rust ends with a semicolon
